Since the beginning of the Godfile, information has been stored in a single monolithic word document. While this simplifies the distribution of content, it is an ineffective and outdated way of sharing notes. This is because:

- Word/Google Docs have **bad version control** tools. Multiple copies of the Godfile currently exist, and there is no indication to which is the latest.

- It can be tiresome to **manually scan through a large document**. Even worse, the burden is on contributors to ensure notes are formatted correctly.

- **The content is outdated**. Maybe its time to rewrite the Godfile up to the latest course outline.

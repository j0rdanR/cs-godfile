# Contributing

- [Styling](contributing/styling) - Write documents using markdown. Learn the additional functionality available to contributors.

- [Structure and organisation](contributing/structure-and-organisation). The `content` directory requires documents to be properly added, and you'll need to annotate your documents appropriately with frontmatter.
